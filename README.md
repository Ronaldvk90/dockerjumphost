# Welcome! This is a ready to go instant ssh jumphost. Just add docker. ;)

This container uses Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS.

Simply edit "run.sh" to suite your needs/hostname.

Be aware! You must edit the adduser.sh and deluser.sh scripts to suite the container name if you choose to edit run.sh!

type "./adduser.sh user" to create a user. It will prompt for a password.
type "./deluser.sh user" to remove the user. The user home directory will be destroyed as well.

Thank you!
